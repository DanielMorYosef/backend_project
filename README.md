# backend_project
 This is my node js module project
I am including a link to full postman documentation ("https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/35988848/2sAXqqci5E")
Please notice the ENV file in this project 
Once runned and connected to mongo initial data service will be called and create 3 users and 3 cards as instructed.
A log folder will be made when a 400=> status  request is made and log its details (bonus mission)
